The end goal was to develop a way to estimate a person’s brain size while they were still alive (as the living aren’t keen on having their brains taken out and weighed).\n","\n","**We wish to determine if we can improve on our model of the linear relationship between head size and brain weight in healthy human adults.**\n","\n","Source: R.J.
