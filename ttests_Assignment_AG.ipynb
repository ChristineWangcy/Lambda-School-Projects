However, it may not be practical for an army that is on the move to set up and carry mosquito nets each night and day. Impregnating soldiersâ€™ uniforms with insect repellent solves the mobility problem but also has drawbacks. First, the insect repellent quickly becomes ineffective with repeated washing and ironing and must be frequently reapplied. Second, in hot and humid climates the insect repellent can be absorbed through the skin, and the long-term effects of this exposure are unknown. One compromise is to have soldiers apply patches treated with insect repellent to their clothing. These patches would last longer because they would not be washed or ironed and would not expose the entire body to the insect repellent.\n","\n","### Dataset Description\n","\n","The `Mosquito.xlsx` dataset contains data recorded in an experiment conducted on male soldiers in the Indian Army who were stationed in the Tezpur/Solmara garrison in Northeast India. Thirty soldiers were randomly selected to receive one of three types of mosquito single repellent patch. After giving informed consent, the study participants affixed the patches at predetermined points on their uniforms and research assistants (who were blinded to the type of repellent used) counted the number of times a mosquito landed on each individual in an hour. \n","\n","Medical officers with the Indian Army have recorded data on mosquito bites and related illness for many years and can say with authority that the mean number of mosquito touches for soldiers not wearing any mosquito repellent is 8.2 per hour.**We wish to determine if wearing a single repellent patch changes the mean number of mosquito touches for soldiers compared to not wearing any mosquito repellant.**\n","\n","*Adapted from: A.
